# DevApp
A chatting app especially made for developers.

## Description
The motiviation behind this project was to provide an interactive app for developers. Most of the developers collaborate for projects and sometimes even companies collaborate together on the same project. Their Dev teams work together and write emails to let eachother know about the progress because most of the times all they have is their mail not the phone numbers or other details. So the only way of communication between dev teams are writing mails. The problem that this website solves is that it lets you sign in with your gmail so say bye to the boring formal mails! Just text eachother in reqaltime and get responses faster. It's very easy to use and can connect dev teams easily and efficiently without even sharing their phone numbers. And the best thing about this app is that you dont have to add people. Whoever Logs in automatically makes itself visible to everyone using the app.
